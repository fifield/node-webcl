This is an implementation of WebCL (i.e. OpenCL) for node.js.

There is currently no standardized API for OpenCL in JavaScript.  This 
implementation is based on the proposed API found at 
http://webcl.nokiaresearch.com/ with minor changes.

WebCL for node is developed by Jeff Fifield.  The most current version can be 
found at https://github.com/fifield/node-webcl.

Documentation can be found at https://github.com/fifield/node-webcl/wiki/

If this is useful to you, please consider contributing to development and 
testing!
